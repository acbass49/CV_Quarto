# Simple Quarto Resume Template
My personal CV template with Latex and Quarto.  

Wrote up a blog post about this [here](https://alexbass.me/posts/resume/). 

TLDR: Feel free to copy and use as you like. Most of it is built in LaTeX, so google that if you want to customize the template. Shell script is also included to show a few file automations when updating my resume.
